# Scan-Crack-SSH
A simple Python tool to Scan an IP for open port 22 among others and try to BruteForce it.

All you need to change is the path of the list you wanna use to hack the credentials.
I recommand you to use your own list that must be built like a dictionnary attack :
username:password

This tool is part of my learning projects in Python for Pen Testing activities.
